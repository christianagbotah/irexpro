\## Current Sprint Checkpoint

Last completed sprint: Sprint 14 — Performance Fee Invoice Payment Flow + Provider Checkout Assignment.



Last verified status:

\- NestJS: 540 tests passing, 32 suites

\- No pending migrations

\- No open handles

\- No Python files touched

\- Performance-fee invoice checkout flow added

\- Provider assignment uses PaymentRoutingService

\- Checkout does not mark invoice/assessment paid

\- Verified webhook remains the only PAID/HWM path

\- Manual/admin settlement intentionally skipped



\## Critical Safety Rules

\- No live broker withdrawals.

\- No auto-charge.

\- Do not mark invoice PAID without verified webhook.

\- Do not update high-water mark outside verified payment webhook.

\- Do not trust frontend payment success.

\- Do not charge deposits/top-ups.

\- Do not charge unrealised/open trades.

\- Do not charge demo/paper/backtest/mock trades.

\- Do not expose secrets, credentials, tokens, raw webhook payloads, card data, or mobile money PINs.

\- All money values must remain decimal-safe.

\## Model Strategy

\- Main implementation: Claude Sonnet 5

\- Small fixes/docs: Sonnet 4.5 or Composer

\- Opus 4.8 only for rare final/deep audits because it consumes too many tokens.
