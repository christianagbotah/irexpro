\## Current Sprint Checkpoint

Last completed sprint: Sprint 15 — Paystack Sandbox Checkout Integration.



Last verified status:

\- NestJS: 609 tests passing, 38 suites

\- No pending migrations

\- No open handles

\- No Python files touched

\- PaystackPaymentProvider upgraded from fail-closed placeholder to real sandbox implementation

\- PaystackHttpClient (native fetch, no SDK) added for all Paystack API calls

\- Subscription checkout and performance-fee invoice checkout both work with Paystack — no business-logic changes needed in either service

\- Webhook signature verification is HMAC-SHA512 over the raw body, fails closed on any missing input

\- Checkout does not mark invoice/subscription/assessment paid

\- Verified webhook remains the only PAID/HWM/subscription-activation path

\- Manual/admin settlement intentionally skipped

\- No secrets (PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY, webhook secret, Authorization header) in logs, responses, or errors



\## Critical Safety Rules

\- No live broker withdrawals.

\- No auto-charge.

\- Do not mark invoice PAID without verified webhook.

\- Do not update high-water mark outside verified payment webhook.

\- Do not trust frontend payment success.

\- Do not charge deposits/top-ups.

\- Do not charge unrealised/open trades.

\- Do not charge demo/paper/backtest/mock trades.

\- Do not expose secrets, credentials, tokens, raw webhook payloads, card data, or mobile money PINs.

\- All money values must remain decimal-safe.

\- Paystack provider must fail closed unless PAYSTACK_ENABLED=true and a secret key is configured.

\- Paystack Transaction Verify (getTransactionStatus) is read-only confirmation only — never a substitute for webhook signature verification.

\## Model Strategy

\- Main implementation: Claude Sonnet 5

\- Fallback: Claude Sonnet 4.6

\- Small fixes/docs: Sonnet 4.5 or Composer

\- Opus 4.8 only for rare final/deep audits because it consumes too many tokens.
