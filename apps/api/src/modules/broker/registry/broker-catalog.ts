/**
 * BROKER_CATALOG — static, versioned broker definitions.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE server-side source of truth for the broker catalog
 * (Directive §AU: web, Android and iOS must all render this same registry —
 * no client-side broker lists).
 *
 * STATUS HONESTY (Directive §AB): every entry's status MUST match actual
 * implementation evidence in this repository:
 * - metatrader5  → SUPPORTED (full IBrokerAdapter via MetaApi, tested)
 * - paper-broker → SUPPORTED (deterministic simulation adapter, tested; cannot go LIVE)
 * - OANDA        → BETA (Sprint 51 PR-7: full v20 REST adapter implemented +
 *   shared §AN contract suite + unit specs; NOT yet live-verified against a
 *   real OANDA practice account — see docs/brokers/oanda-v20-adapter.md)
 * - cTrader → NOT_STARTED / PARTNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED (no adapter — OAuth app +
 *   partner approval required before any build; do not fabricate support)
 * - Pepperstone / IC Markets / FP Markets via cTrader → PARTNER_APPROVAL_REQUIRED
 *   (requires operator research + partner approval before any build — see
 *   docs/brokers/provider-matrix.md)
