 * ExecutionIntent — Directive PHASE D "execution intent".

 * dispatch to a provider. This is the single input contract of
 * ExecutionOrchestrator.dispatchOrder(): everything downstream (order
 * reservation, provider dispatch, response handling, state transitions)
 * derives from this object.
 *
 * INVARIANTS:
 * - The intent has ALREADY passed the Risk Engine (APPROVED) — the risk gate
 *   lives upstream in ExecutionService.executeTrade() and is never bypassed.
 * - Quantities and prices are decimal STRINGS (never floats).
 * - clientOrderId is the idempotency surface: the same clientOrderId always
 *   maps to the same persisted order (SHA-256(userId:clientOrderId)) and is
 *   NEVER dispatched twice.

 *
 * - FILLED      — provider executed the order (fill quantity + VWAP price known)
 * - WORKING     — provider accepted the order; fill arrives asynchronously
 *                 (e.g. LIMIT/STOP orders resting at the provider)
 * - REJECTED    — provider definitively refused (no execution happened)
 * - UNKNOWN     — dispatch errored/timed out; the provider-side outcome is
 *                 UNKNOWN and both order + trade are RECONCILIATION_PENDING
 *                 (fail-closed — never silently dropped)

 *                 was dispatched (exactly-once dispatch guarantee)
